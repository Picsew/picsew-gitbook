# FAQ

**Why does scrollshot stitching fail?**

The scrollshot stitching requires a sufficient height of overlap between your screenshots, about two lines of text height. If there is not enough overlap area, it can't be automatically stitched. Also note that a chat screenshot with a custom chat background will also fail, because the background image interferes with the matching area detection.

The app will automatically select iPad, iPhone or iPhone X as the mockup according to the ratio of the stitching result.
