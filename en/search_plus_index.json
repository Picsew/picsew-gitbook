Why the image is blank after saving it to system photo album? This is a bug in iOS 10. When the image's file size is too big, viewing the image in the system photo album may show a blank image.

Sending it to a computer can be used normally. If you close the \"Prefers Saving as PNG\" option, you can solve this problem. Why does the device mockup function sometimes disappear? Because the principle of adding a mockup is not cutting the original image, so only when the ratio of the stitching result is long enough, the appropriate device mockup can be added. The app will automatically selects iPad, iPhone or iPhone X as the mockup according to the ratio of the stitching result. Why after adding a device mockup, view it in the system album, the top and the bottom of image are both cut? This is the display problem of the system album. Double-click image to zoom in, then pinch to zoom out, now you can see the complete image. Why the web snapshot extension shows blank page on launching?
